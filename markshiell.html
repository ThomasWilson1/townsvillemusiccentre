	<p>Mark has guest-conducted ensembles including the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, West Australian Symphony, Moscow Symphony Orchestra, State Academic Symphony Orchestra of St. Petersburg, Victorian Opera, Orchestra Ensemble Kanazawa, Canberra Symphony Orchestra, Sydney Sinfonia, Melbourne Youth Orchestra, University of Melbourne Symphony Orchestra and the Orchestras of the State Music Camps in Melbourne and Adelaide.
Currently he serves as Artistic Director and Principal Conductor of Zelman Symphony Orchestra, the Ballarat Symphony and the Macquarie Philharmonia.
His love of community and youth music has kept him busy contributing to the growth and development of important initiatives in both of these areas here in Australia. Most recently, Mark developed a Regional Orchestra Weekend for ensembles from across Victoria to meet and perform together, with the aim to make this an annual event.
        Mark is also passionate about the education and training of future conductors, and has been frequently involved as a guest teacher of the Masters of Conducting students at the Melbourne Conservatorium in 2015.</p>
